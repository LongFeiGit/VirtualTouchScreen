   This application aims at improving user experience by providing a touch screen experience with gestures. 
Currently touch screen enabled-applications have become increasingly popular. However, classical PCs cannot 
benefit from this new type of input. This application tries to fill this gap by providing touch screen experience
 on any type of PC/device using a Creative Interactive Gesture Camera and perceptual computing.

   The application supports the main eight gestures (according to Windows 8 Touch Language): 
- Press and Hold, 
- Tap, 
- Slide, 
- Swipe, 
- Pinch, 
- Stretch, 
- Swipe From Edge and 
- Turn. 
A configuration dialog is provided in order to assign these gestures to given key combinations. If desired, 
a visual element shall appear on the screen in order to facilitate the user interaction when, for example, 
one desires to click an element on the screen. Internally, hand and fingers tracking is used in order to obtain 
hand position and to implement gestures detection. Also openCV is used in order to filter hand coordinates.

   A virtual keyboard is implemented in order to ensure application input using gestures. Window drag 
and drop and application menu activation can be configured with gestures. Voice control is used also for 
activating menu actions.
